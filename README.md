Network simulation programs

Problem statement 1: Three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

Problem statement 2: Simulate a four node point-to-point network, and connect the links as follows: n0-n2, n1-n2 and n2-n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP agent between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents by changing the parameters and determine the number of packets sent by TCP/UD

Problem statement 3: Simulate simple Extended Service Set with transmitting nodes in wireless LAN and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.
